Example 3:
Input: 10
Step 1: 1+0 = 1 (Expected output)

Example 4:
Input: 11
Step 1: 1+1 = 2 (Expected output)

Example 5:
Input: 12
Step 1: 1+2 = 3 (Expected output)

Example 6:
Input: 18
Step 1: 1+8 = 9 (Expected output)

Arguments: In mathematics we have learnt that any number that is divisible by 9, t
he sum of the digits in the number is also divisible by 9. 
Also, here we know that the result of the problem is an integer lying in the range [0,9] .
